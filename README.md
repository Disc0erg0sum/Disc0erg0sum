## Hi, I'm Disco Ergo Sum 🪩

**Yes, this profile looks a bit empty.** My best work is tucked away in private corporate repos (thanks, NDAs).

I'm currently doing some "digital spring cleaning" and migrating my personal projects to [**Codeberg**](https://codeberg.org/). You can follow my latest open-source activities there: **[DiscoErgoSum @ codeberg](https://codeberg.org/DiscoErgoSum/DiscoErgoSum#hi-i-m-disco-ergo-sum-now-officially-github-free)**
